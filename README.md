# Open Source Knowledge Base

- Here I compile sources and knowledge about Linux, open source and other topics that interest me. 
- I will also try to write some Linux guides for non-tech users in german.
- Feel free to use the contents for whatever purpose you like.

## TODO-List:
- Structure site content (de/en and techie/user)
- Configure Apollo theme

## Topic ideas
### Linux basics 
1. Intro and History (also include other UNIX-like operating systems)

3. Desktop Environments (also include Tiling Manager, Wayland, xorg -> X11)
4. Users and Groups
5. File Systems and directory structure (include privileges)
6. Packages and Package managers

### Advanced Linux (more tech oriented)
1. A closer look at the kernel
2. Containerization
3. vi, vim and all it forks
4. Git (incl. Git forges)

6. 

### General Topics
1. Open Source (Definition, FOSS, License Models, etc.)
2. Cloud-Computing (incl. buzzword explanations like Hyperscaler, zero knowledge providers, etc.)
